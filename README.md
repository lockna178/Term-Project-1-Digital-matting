## Our project 
Our core algorithm's goal is to, fundamentally, swap one defined color for another. This is the purpose of chroma-keying in modern video/photo editing. This code is an attempt at replicating a simple chromakey tool which can be found in Adobe After Effects, Premiere Pro, and so on. 

## Use explanation
1. Prepare source images / videos
2. Take color sample
3. Define color threshold
4. Masking blur
5. Replace space with another image / video / black color
